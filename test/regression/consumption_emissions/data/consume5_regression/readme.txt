The input files are similar to the files in consume_consume directory with fm_litter (30) and season (fall) columns added. 

The output files were created using Consume5 and the "natural" option like so: 

Brians-MacBook-Pro:apps-consumeGIT briandrye$ python consume_batch.py -l 3 -o ~/repos/uw/bluesky/bluesky/test/regression/consumption_emissions/data/consume5_regression/scen_1_out.csv natural ~/repos/uw/bluesky/bluesky/test/regression/consumption_emissions/data/consume5_regression/scen_1.csv
